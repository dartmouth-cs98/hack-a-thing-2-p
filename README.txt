Hack a thing 2- Khalil Jackson

	I saw a couple of peoples games during the last hack a thing, so it made me want to
make my own game.  I downloaded Unity and went through one of their more intensive projects
since I have worked a little with Unity before.  The type of game I made was a rouge like,
which is a game genre that uses procedural generation to create the overall game design.
The tutorial came with some really in-depth source code that explained all of the ADTs and
game physics.  Most of the project involded the Unity workflow and properly interacting with 
the software.  One of the techniques I liked was the folder organization (something my desktop could use).
One of the initial things they tell you to do is make a complete folder.  I worked on objects
one at a time through Unity and once I finished them I moved the objects to the complete folder.
It's a pretty simple idea, but it's the first time I've seen it implemented in this kind of 
format.
